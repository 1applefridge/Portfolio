Next, I made a CSS class dark-mode to define dark mode features, such as the background and the text. Finally, I made the JavaScript file, where whenever the button is clicked, dark-mode is removed or added from the text and background, and the button changes to a moon or sun icon. I also made sure to add the changes to the local storage so it would be remembered when someone moves to a new page."
